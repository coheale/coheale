- 👋 Hi, I’m Cody
- 👀 I’m interested in software designed to better humans and their opportunities, and really anything CS-related. I hope to dabble in machine
learning as well as web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, C, Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that relate to global development, community service, or anything where my skills could be applied.
